As a Data Scientist at Fiserv, I design and implement data-driven solutions to improve merchant retention, optimize operations, and support strategic decision-making. My work spans client retention programs, real-time emotion modeling for customer interactions, lead list generation, and large-scale distributed computing using PySpark and Palantir Foundry. I also develop and optimize complex SQL Server queries for performance at enterprise scale.

I hold two master’s degrees in Statistics and Operations Research from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I also served as a graduate teaching and research assistant. Previously, as a Research Scientist I at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, I applied data science and optimization to complex challenges in defense, health, and electronics.

Proficient in Python, SQL, MATLAB, R, C, C++, C#, and Java, I work across both cloud and on-premises platforms. I focus on building explainable, high-impact models, improving computational efficiency, and applying analytical rigor to solve complex problems—always with the goal of creating transparent, actionable insights that drive measurable business outcomes.
